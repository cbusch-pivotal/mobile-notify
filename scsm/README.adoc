== Spring Cloud Stream Modules 

This project provides a collection of Spring Cloud Stream modules for us in the mobile-notify application.  They can be run on their own and scaled as necessary to support the influx of data.

=== Building

Some modules may require an external server to execute, e.g. redis.  If the external server is not found, the tests will be skipped.
